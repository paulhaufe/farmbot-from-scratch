# Stepper Motors

The NEMA 17 stepper motors used with Farmbot are so-called *closed-loop motors*, because the consist of an open loop motor combined with a rotary motor encoder. The encoder reads the steps taken by the motor and gives feedback used for speed and/or position control.

There are two possibilities to purchase closed-loop stepper motors

* all-in-one closed loop motor from a single vendor
* double-shaft open loop motor from one vendor and an encoder module from another vendor that is mounted onto the rear shaft

## Official Farmbot parts
* [1704HS168A](http://motechmotor.com/productDetail-0104-32.html) from Motech with rear shaft option
* [HS28A](http://global.honestsensor.com.tw/pdf/HS28A_en.pdf) from Honest Sensor
