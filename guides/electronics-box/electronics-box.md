# Electronics Box guide
This guide shows you how to source a generic electronics box and install the Farmduino and Raspberry Pi devices.

## The box
You won't need a sophisticated box that looks exactly like [the one from Farmbot](https://genesis.farm.bot/v1.6/bom/electronics-and-wiring/electronics-box#) with a transparent cover and all holes in place already. A simple plastic enclosure with the right dimensions and ESD protection will do it.
