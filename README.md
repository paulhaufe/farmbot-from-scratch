# A guide how to build farmbot from scratch
Are you planning to source all components of farmbot including the PCBs (Farmduino, Raspberry PI Adapter, etc.) on your own and build it from scratch? Fine, then this is the guide to go with, cause it has been done and documented already.

All those docs here extend the [official Farmbot documentation](https://genesis.farm.bot) by adding a few guides that show how to source, mount and install custom made parts.
